# Critical Fixes Applied to LoveTravel Child Theme

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue #1: Admin Page Template Executing Everywhere
**Problem**: `payload-import-admin-page.php` was being included directly in `functions.php`, causing HTML output on every admin page.
**Fix**: Removed template from `functions.php` includes - templates should only be included by admin page callbacks.

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue #2: Wrong Parent Theme Style Dependency  
**Problem**: Child theme was looking for `lovetravel-parent-style` but parent theme uses `nicdark-style`.
**Fix**: Updated style dependency to `nicdark-style` to match parent theme.

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue #3: Integration Classes Instantiating Too Early
**Problem**: Classes were instantiated immediately when files were included, before WordPress was ready.
**Fix**: Moved class instantiation to proper WordPress hooks (`admin_init`).

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue #4: Wrong Hook Timing
**Problem**: Admin integrations were loading on `init` hook, affecting frontend pages.
**Fix**: Changed to `admin_init` hook and added admin context checks.

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issue #5: Duplicate Textdomain Loading
**Problem**: Theme textdomain was being loaded in two places, causing conflicts.
**Fix**: Removed duplicate loading, kept only in theme-setup.php.
